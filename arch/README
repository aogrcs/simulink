This repository contains a MATLAB script to translate automatically from Simulink diagrams into Why code (for the Why3 theorem proving tool). A manual of the script is included. Other developed Simulink blocks for the verification are also supplied. They need to exist in MATLAB's work path. 

The folder "Examples" contains illustrative examples on the verification of high-level properties of control systems implemented in Simulink, through numerical analysis or theorem proving in Why3. Other Simulink files (*.mdl) are needed in order to make the examples work. 

To verify the *.why files in the examples, the files simulink2.why and matrix.why need to be added to the why3 installation directory in the system (e.g., /usr/local/share/why3/theories in Ubuntu). More information on how to use Why3 is provided in: http://why3.lri.fr/
